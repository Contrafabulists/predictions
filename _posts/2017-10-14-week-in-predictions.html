<p><strong>The Trump Administration announced the US will withdraw from UNESCO by 2018</strong>. I&#8217;m not sure if the correct verb is &#8220;announced&#8221; or &#8220;predicted,&#8221; but I feel like there&#8217;s a certain amount of uncertainty with any statement from this White House so I&#8217;m including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html">this news</a> here.</p>

Of course, &#8220;this&#8221; presumes you&#8217;re living in the Global North with access to broadband, gadgets, and a disposable income.</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>Digital payments expected to hit 726 billion by 2020</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html">says CNBC</a>.</p>
