<p><em><a href="http://contrafabulists.com">The Contrafabulists</a> &#8211; <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a> &#8211; monitor predictions that technologists and marketers make about the future of technology. No surprise, most of the predictions are made about AI, a development whose future folks have been predicting incorrectly since the 1950s. Here are the predictions made this week:</em></p>

<p>Forrester, one of the best known corporate fortune-tellers, <a href="https://readwrite.com/2017/07/22/forrester-self-driving-report-tl1/">predicts</a> that <strong>self-driving cars will make the global economy &#8220;unrecognizable&#8221; by 2035</strong>.</p>

<p>Gartner, that other famous fortune-teller, <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/07/25/research-it-spending-to-hit-3.5-trillion-in-2017.aspx">predicts</a> that <strong>IT spending will hit $3.5 trillion in 2017</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://seriousplayconf.com/downloads/2017-2022-global-game-based-learning-market/">According to a report from the Serious Play Conference</a>, <strong>revenue from serious games will reach $8.1 billion by 2022</strong>. The report costs $499. I predict the market for research will continue to grow if people continue to spend money on this bullshit.</p>

<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2017/07/25/adobe-to-finally-pull-plug-o.html"><strong>Adobe says it&#8217;ll axe Flash by 2020</strong></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/2017/07/08/week-in-predictions">On the heels</a> of a similar announcement by France, <strong><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608347/britain-is-getting-rid-of-the-internal-combustion-engine/">the UK says</a> it will end the sale of new cars that run on gas or diesel by 2040</strong>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the second week in a row that predictions about the future of China and AI have made headlines. <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/07/20/china-says-itll-world-ai-leader-2025/">According to The Next Web</a>, &#8220;<strong>China says it&#8217;ll be world AI leader by 2025</strong>.&#8221; (<a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/2017/07/22/week-in-predictions">Last week</a>, the prediction date was 2030.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hbcudigest.com/about-50-hbcus-will-survive-the-next-decade-its-time-to-start-investing-in-them/">HBCU Digest predicts</a> that <strong>only about half of HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) will survive the next decade</strong>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pet translators will be on sale soon, Amazon says&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/22/hear-boy-pet-translators-will-be-on-sale-soon-amazon-says">says The Guardian</a>, at least, repeating the prediction made by futurologist William Higham who, along with Amazon, &#8220;believes <strong>devices that can talk dog could be less than 10 years away</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>(In the spirit of that prediction, I must include <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/amazon-completes-new-suspension-tank-house-psychic-56499">this from The Onion</a>:
&#8220;Amazon Completes New Suspension Tank To House Psychic Beings Who Foresee Customers&#8217; Future Orders.&#8221;)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/techs-most-dubious-promises-from-bill-gates-to-elon-musk/">From Wired</a>: &#8220;Tech&#8217;s Most Dubious Promises, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk.&#8221; This includes <strong>Gates&#8217; promise in 2004 that &#8220;Two years from now, spam will be solved.&#8221;</strong> And <strong>Sebastian Thrun&#8217;s prediction that in 50 years, &#8220;there would be only 10 institutions in the world delivering higher education &#8211;and Udacity could be one of them.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608333/the-tech-world-is-convinced-2021-is-going-to-be-the-best-year-ever/">MIT Technology Review says that</a> &#8220;<strong>The Tech World Is Convinced 2021 Is Going to Be the Best Year Ever</strong>.&#8221; Among the tech products that are supposed to be commonplace by 2021, virtual reality, self-driving cars, cheap solar power, and lab-grown chicken.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not really a prediction per se, but according to researchers at Lund University (and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140668-ravens-can-plan-for-future-as-well-as-4-year-old-children-can/#link_time=1500388686">reported by New Scientist</a>), &#8220;Ravens can plan for future events at least as well as 4-year-old humans and some adult, non-human great apes.&#8221; And perhaps even the PR folks who make the sorts of predictions chronicled above&#8230;</p>
