<p>Each week since we&#8217;ve launched this project chronicling technology predictions, Audrey has typed up a list of the predictions she&#8217;s seen &#8211; something that typically happens as she scours news and analysis for updates about <a href="http://robots.hackeducation.com">robots</a> or <a href="http://hackeducation.com">education technology</a>.</p>

<p>Kin, on the other hand, is taking a more programmatic approach to this project. He&#8217;s been scraping various technology publications and looking for phrases that articles contain some sort of prediction: &#8220;by the year&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;within the next [number] years&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>You can see the data he&#8217;s collected &#8211; warning, it hasn&#8217;t really been cleaned up yet &#8211; in this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/Contrafabulists/tech-predictions">Contrafabulists/tech-predictions</a>. A sample of predictions from the tech blog Techcrunch, for example, can be found <a href="https://contrafabulists.github.io/tech-predictions/techcrunch/">here</a>.</p>
