<p><em><a href="http://contrafabulists.com">The Contrafabulists</a> monitor predictions that technologists and marketers make each week about the future of technology:</em></p>

<p>&#8220;I think in the <strong>next 30 years</strong>, people only <strong>work four hours a day</strong> and maybe four days a week,&#8221; <a href="http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/jack-ma-predicts-people-will-work-just-16-hours-per-wee-1796323899">the chairman of Alibaba Jack Ma predicted</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edtechstrategies.com/blog/are-we-there-yet/">EdTech Strategies&#8217; Doug Levin revisits the predictions</a> made in the 2008 book <em>Disrupting Class</em> that &#8220;the growth in computer-based delivery of education will accelerate swiftly until, <strong>by 2019, half of all high school classes will be taught over the Internet</strong>.&#8221; &#8220;Are we on track?&#8221; Levin asks.</p>

<p><a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/immersive-tech-virtual-reality-market-soar-worldwide-new-analysis-predicts/">Education Week publishes the latest predictions from Futuresource</a>: &#8220;In the pre-college market, the number of students who access <strong>virtual, augmented, or mixed reality</strong> through <strong>head-mounted displays</strong> will leap from <strong>2.1 million in 2016</strong> to nearly <strong>83 million in 2021</strong>, Futuresource says.&#8221; (Do 2.1 million students use VR today?)</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong>By 2025</strong>, 50 percent of an <strong>undergraduate degree</strong> will become <strong>obsolete</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-21-why-a-robot-filled-education-future-may-not-be-as-scary-as-you-think">predicts a columnist on the ed-tech industry website Edsurge</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-18-why-i-m-optimistic-about-the-next-wave-of-education-technology">A venture capitalist predicts on Edsurge that</a> &#8220;My bet is that <strong>by 2040</strong>, our children will look back on this period between 2015 and 2030 in <strong>education technology</strong> much the same way internet historians look to the period 1995 to 2010 as the <strong>birth of the commercial web</strong>.&#8221; I guess this prediction means that the history of education technology will be taught in schools? I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/passenger-economy.pdf">From the prediction company Strategy Analytics</a>: &#8220;Our research finds that <strong>autonomous driving technology</strong> will enable a new
Passenger Economy worth <strong>US$7 trillion in 2050</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aviation experts think <strong>five years</strong> is a reasonable timeframe for the development of practical <strong>flying cars</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/neva-airquadone-flying-cars-paris-air-show">according to those aviation experts Wired Magazine asked, at least</a>.</p>
