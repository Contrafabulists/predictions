<p><a href="http://contrafabulists.com">The Contrafabulists</a> &#8211; <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com">Audrey Watters</a> &#8211; monitor predictions that technologists and marketers make about the future of technology:</p>

<p><a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/2017/07/01/week-in-predictions">Once again</a>, the prediction (often credited to the World Economic Forum) &#8211; that &#8220;almost <strong>65 percent of the jobs</strong> elementary school students will be doing in the future <strong>do not even exist yet</strong>&#8221; &#8211; got trotted out, <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2017/07/04/7-critical-skills-for-the-jobs-of-the-future/">this time by Singularity Hub</a>. Other predictions in that particular article: &#8220;<strong>In the next five years</strong>, <strong>non-permanent and remote workers</strong> are expected to make up <strong>40 percent of the average company&#8217;s total workforce</strong>.&#8221; Honestly, if you read these sorts of stories and hear these sorts of predictions, you simply must have questions. Like, what is an &#8220;average company&#8221;? How does anyone know about jobs that don&#8217;t exist yet? So a special shout-out to <a href="http://edtechcurmudgeon.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-undead-factoid-who-decided-65-of.html">CSU Channel Island&#8217;s Michael Berman, who investigated where that particular &#8220;statistic&#8221; came from</a>.</p>

<p>There were lots of predictions this week about cars &#8211; no surprise, as so many stories about the future involve transportation. <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/how-to/g1038/a-brief-history-of-the-flying-car/">Flying cars and the like</a>. It&#8217;s not so much a prediction than a goal, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/06/frances-climate-plan-includes-ending-fossil-fuel-vehicle-sales-by-2040/"><strong>France</strong> says it plans</a> to <strong>end the sale of fossil-fuel powered cars by 2040</strong>. &#8220;<strong>By 2040</strong>, More Than <strong>Half of All New Cars Could Be Electric</strong>,&#8221; <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608231/by-2040-more-than-half-of-all-new-cars-could-be-electric/">the MIT Technology Review predicts</a> in turn. Much of the chatter this week resulted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/business/energy-environment/volvo-hybrid-electric-car.html">from <strong>Volvo</strong>&#8217;s commitment this week</a>: &#8220;that all the models it introduces <strong>starting in 2019</strong> will be either <strong>hybrids or powered solely by batteries</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in case you wondered why Audrey insists that many stories about the future of education sound particularly horrible, here&#8217;s a prediction from the market research firm Technavio: &#8220;Globally, the <strong>test prep market</strong> is expected to <strong>grow $7.56 billion</strong> between 2016, when it was valued at $24.57 billion, and <strong>2021</strong>, when it is expected to reach <strong>$32.13 billion</strong>.&#8221;</p>
