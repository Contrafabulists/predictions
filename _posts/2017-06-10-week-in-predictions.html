<p><em><a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/">The Contrafabulists monitor predictions </a> that technologists and marketers make each week about the future of technology:</p></em>

<p>&#8220;The Language of Dolphins Could Be Translated by 2021,&#8221; <a href="https://futurism.com/the-language-of-dolphins-could-be-translated-by-2021/">according to Futurism</a>, which should probably note in the fine print that when it says AI has mastered 40 languages, it doesn&#8217;t really mean <em>mastered</em>. Paging William Gibson for this one, because you know the dolphin AI applications are un-good.</p>

<p>&#8220;IoT to Represent More Than Half of Connected Device Landscape by 2021,&#8221; <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/06/09/iot-to-represent-more-than-half-of-connected-device-landscape-by-2021.aspx">says Campus Technology</a>, repeating PR from Cisco, which has absolutely zero stake in connectivity I&#8217;m sure.</p>
