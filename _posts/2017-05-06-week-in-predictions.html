<p><em>As part of <a href="http://predictions.contrafabulists.com/">a new Contrafabulists' project</a>, we are monitoring predictions that technologists make each week...</em></p>

<p><a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/k-12-ed-tech-platform-tools-market-value-increase-1-83-billion-2020-report-says/">Education Week&#8217;s &#8220;Market Brief&#8221;</a> rewrites a market research press release, predicting that &#8220;As more computing devices are available in K&#8211;12 classrooms, <strong>the market for ed-tech software and tools and back-end administrative technology platforms, is expected to grow to $1.83 billion by 2020</strong>, according to Futuresource Consulting, Ltd.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/05/03/the-future-of-jobs-and-jobs-training/">The Pew Research Center interviews &#8220;experts&#8221;</a> about the <strong>future of jobs and job training</strong>. It imposed a &#8220;ten-years-in-the-future&#8221; timeframe to many of its questions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/upshot/how-to-prepare-for-an-automated-future.html">The New York Times covers the Pew Research report</a>, noting that two-thirds of respondents said that &#8220;<strong>new schooling will emerge in the next decade to successfully train workers for the future</strong>.&#8221;</p>

<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that <strong>38% of American jobs could be automated by 2030</strong>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/05/01/millennials-arent-robot-proof/">says The Washington Post</a>, and urges millennials to pursue work in <strong>health-care support in hospitals and nursing homes, a sector which is &#8220;projected to grow 23 percent from 2014 to 2024.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p><strong>A machine will be able to smell if you&#8217;re sick in a &#8220;three- to five-year time frame,&#8221;</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html">according to Cristina Davis, a biomedical engineer and professor at UC Davis</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-death-of-the-smartphone-is-closer-than-you-think-heres-what-comes-next/">ZDNet doesn&#8217;t give a timeframe but predicts</a> that &#8220;<strong>The death of the smartphone is closer than you think</strong>.&#8221;</p>
