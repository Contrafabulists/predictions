<p>"Books will soon be obsolete in schools," Edison predicted in 1913. "I think there is a world maket for maybe five computers," Thomas Watson, the president of IBM, said in 1943. "Within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved," Marvin Minksy said in 1965. "In 50 years, there will be only 10 institutions in the world delivering higher education and Udacity has a shot at being one of them," Sebastian Thrun predicted in 2012. "We will reach Mars by 2025," Elon Musk insisted in 2016.</p>

<p>Technologists love to predict the future. Indeed, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil">an entire Wikipedia entry devoted to the predictions of futurist Ray Kurzweil</a>. His track record for getting "the future" right is... not good.</p>

<p>As a reminder, The Contrafabulists' website says,</p>

<p><em>Fabulists are fable-spinners and myth-makers. We are storytellers ourselves, but we poke holes in the hype and distortion of new digital technologies and the narratives associated with them. Contrafabulists are, as the name would suggest, against lying.</em></p>

<p>This project will track the predictions being made about the future. Who's right? Who's wrong? And who are the loudest voices shaping not so much the future as much as our imagination about what the future is supposed to look like?</p>
